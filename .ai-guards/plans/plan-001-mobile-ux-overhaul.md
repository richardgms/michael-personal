## üß© Scope

This plan outlines a comprehensive mobile-first refactoring for key components of the website. The objective is to enhance the user experience on small viewports (‚â§ 640px) by improving layout, performance, accessibility, and usability, without altering the existing desktop design.

## ‚úÖ Functional Requirements

- **Hero.tsx:**
  - The hero section must not take up the full screen height on mobile, occupying roughly 60% of the viewport height (`min-h-[60vh]`).
  - Content order must be reversed on mobile (`flex-col-reverse`), showing text content before the main image.
  - The image wrapper must be constrained to prevent layout shifts and maintain aspect ratio.
  - Call-to-action (CTA) buttons must be centered and have an adequate tap target size.

- **Transformations.tsx:**
  - The vertical list of transformations must be converted into a horizontal, swipeable carousel on mobile.
  - The carousel must use native CSS `scroll-snap` for a smooth, performant "locking" experience on each item.
  - Each item in the carousel must have a defined width (`w-[68vw]`) and aspect ratio (`aspect-[3/4]`).

- **StoryText.tsx:**
  - Long-form text paragraphs must be optimized for readability with a max-width and fluid typography (`clamp()`).

- **Plans.tsx:**
  - The multi-column grid must collapse to a single-column layout on mobile.
  - Badges on plan cards must be moved to an `absolute` position on mobile to save vertical space.

- **Testimonials.tsx:**
  - The layout must stack vertically (`flex-col`) on mobile.
  - The testimonial image must be appropriately sized for mobile screens.

- **Footer.tsx:**
  - Links must have increased padding to ensure easy tapping.
  - The entire footer must respect iOS safe-area insets to avoid UI elements being obscured.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - All images must use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`.
  - A `sizes` attribute must be provided to all images to optimize LCP: `(max-width: 640px) 80vw, 33vw`.
  - The root element of the page must prevent horizontal overflow (`overflow-x-hidden`).

- **Accessibility:**
  - All interactive elements (links, buttons) must have a minimum tap target size of 44x44px.
  - Keyboard navigation must be clear; footer links will have a visible focus state (`focus-visible`).
  - Text must be legible, using fluid typography (`clamp()`) to adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Usability:**
  - The layout must feel native to mobile devices, using common patterns like horizontal carousels.
  - The UI must adapt to iOS device notches and home bars (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`).

## üìö Guidelines & Packages

- **Guidelines:** Follow existing project structure using Next.js and Tailwind CSS utility-first classes. All changes for mobile should be prefixed with responsive modifiers (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`) to ensure they do not affect desktop views.
- **Packages:** No new packages required. The implementation will use features from `next/image` and `tailwindcss`.

## üîê Threat Model

- No new security threats are introduced. This plan is scoped to front-end layout and performance improvements and does not alter data handling, authentication, or server-side logic.

## üî¢ Execution Plan

1.  **Global CSS Setup (`app/globals.css`):**
    - Apply `overflow-x-hidden` to the root `body` or `html` element.
    - Add base styles to respect safe-area insets if not already present.

2.  **Component Refactoring (File-by-File):**
    - **`src/components/Hero.tsx`**:
      - Modify the main section wrapper: apply `min-h-[60vh] sm:min-h-screen`, `flex-col-reverse sm:flex-row`, and safe-area padding (`pt-[env(safe-area-inset-top)]`).
      - Adjust image wrapper and CTA button classes for mobile layout.
    - **`src/components/Transformations.tsx`**:
      - Refactor the main container to a `flex` element with `overflow-x-auto` and `scroll-snap` properties.
      - Apply `shrink-0`, `snap-start`, and sizing classes to child `figure` elements.
    - **`src/components/StoryText.tsx`**:
      - Update the `<p>` tag with `max-w-prose` and fluid text size using `text-[clamp(1rem,3.5vw,1.125rem)]`.
    - **`src/components/Plans.tsx`**:
      - Change the grid class to `grid sm:grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`.
      - Adjust badge classes to be `absolute sm:static`.
    - **`src/components/Testimonials.tsx`**:
      - Change the wrapper to `flex flex-col sm:flex-row`.
      - Update image classes with `w-full max-w-[320px]`.
    - **`src/components/Footer.tsx`**:
      - Add safe-area padding classes to the footer element.
      - Add padding and `focus-visible` classes to all `<a>` tags within the footer.

3.  **Verification & Testing:**
    - Test all changes in a mobile viewport (e.g., Chrome DevTools, width < 640px).
    - Verify that no horizontal scrollbar appears.
    - Inspect tap targets to confirm they meet the 44x44px requirement.
    - Test on a physical iOS device (if possible) to confirm safe-area insets are working.
    - Verify that desktop layouts (width > 768px) remain completely unchanged.
